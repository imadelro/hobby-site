# Hobby Site
## Overview
The Hobby Site aims to create a community where users can share and explore their hobbies. The site is composed of four applications: a merchandise store, a wiki, a blog, and a commission board.

As one of the developers, I focused on building the Blog App, which enables users to share and interact with posts on various hobby-related topics.

## Background
This project was my first experience working with the Django web framework, where I also gained hands-on knowledge in designing frontends using HTML and CSS.

## Features of Blog App
**User-generated Blog Posts**: Users can create, edit, and delete their own posts.

**Post Interactions**: Readers can comment on posts to encourage discussion.

**Admin Panel**: Provides an interface to manage posts and user-generated content.
